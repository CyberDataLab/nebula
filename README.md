**NEBULA** (previously known as Fedstellar[^1]) is a cutting-edge platform designed to facilitate the training of federated models within both centralized and decentralized architectures. It streamlines the development, deployment, and management of federated applications across physical and virtualized devices.

## üöÄ Key Components

NEBULA boasts a **modular architecture** that consists of three core elements:

- **Frontend**: A user-friendly interface for setting up experiments and monitoring progress.
- **Controller**: An orchestrator that ensures efficient operation management.
- **Core**: The fundamental component deployed on each device to handle federated learning processes.

## üåü Main Features

- **Decentralized**: Train models without a central server, leveraging decentralized federated learning.
- **Privacy-preserving**: Maintain data privacy by training on-device and only sharing model updates.
- **Topology-agnostic**: Support for various network topologies including star, ring, and mesh.
- **Model-agnostic**: Compatible with a wide range of machine learning algorithms, from deep learning to traditional methods.
- **Network communication**: Secure and efficient device communication with features like compression, network failure tolerance, and condition simulation.
- **Trustworthiness**: Ensure the integrity of the learning process by verifying the reliability of the federation.
- **Blockchain integration**: Support for blockchain technologies to enhance security and transparency.
- **Security**: Implement security mechanisms to protect the learning process from adversarial attacks.
- **Real-time monitoring**: Provides live performance metrics and visualizations during the learning process.

## üåç Scenario Applications

- üè• **Healthcare**: Train models on medical devices such as wearables, smartphones, and sensors.
- üè≠ **Industry 4.0**: Implement on industrial devices like robots, drones, and constrained devices.
- üì± **Mobile services**: Optimize for mobile devices including smartphones, tablets, and laptops.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Military**: Apply to military equipment such as drones, robots, and sensors.
- üöó **Vehicular scenarios**: Utilize in vehicles including cars, trucks, and drones.

[^1]: Fedstellar was our first version of the platform. We have redesigned the previous functionalities and added new capabilities based on our research. The platform is now called NEBULA and is available as an open-source project.

## üéØ Get Started

To start using NEBULA, follow our detailed [Installation Guide](https://nebula.enriquetomasmb.com/installation.html) and [User Manual](https://nebula.enriquetomasmb.com/user-manual.html). For any queries or contributions, check out our [Contribution Guide](https://nebula.enriquetomasmb.com/contributing.html).

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community to enhance NEBULA. If you are interested in contributing, please follow the next steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch with your feature or bug fix (`git checkout -b feature/your-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/your-feature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
