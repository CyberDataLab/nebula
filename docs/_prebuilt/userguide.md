# **User Guide**

In this section, we will explain how to use the NEBULA Platform

## **Running NEBULA**
![Scenario configuration](static/userguide/running_nebula.png) 

To run NEBULA, you can use the following command line:

    python app/main.py [PARAMS]

The first time you run the platform, the nebula-frontend docker image
will be built. This process can take a few minutes.

You can show the PARAMS using:

    python app/main.py --help

The frontend will be available at http://127.0.0.1:6060 (by default) if the port is available

To change the default port of the frontend, you can use the following
command line:

    python app/main.py --webport [PORT]

To change the default port of the statistics endpoint, you can use the
following command line:

    python app/main.py --statsport [PORT]
