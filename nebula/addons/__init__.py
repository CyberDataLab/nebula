"""
This package consists of several modules that handle different aspects of the network simulation:

1. `env.py`:
   - Manages the environment configuration and settings.
   - It initializes the system environment, loads configuration parameters, and ensures correct operation of other components based on the simulation's settings.

2. `functions.py`:
   - Contains utility functions that are used across different parts of the simulation.
   - It provides helper methods for common operations like data processing, mathematical calculations, and other reusable functionalities.

3. `mobility.py`:
   - Models and simulates the mobility of nodes within the network.
   - It handles dynamic aspects of the simulation, such as node movement and position updates, based on mobility models and the simulation's configuration.

4. `reporter.py`:
   - Responsible for collecting and reporting data during the simulation.
   - It tracks various system metrics, including node status and network performance, and periodically sends updates to a controller or dashboard for analysis and monitoring.

5. `topologymanager.py`:
   - Manages the topology of the network.
   - It handles the creation and maintenance of the network's structure (e.g., nodes and their connections), including generating different types of topologies like ring, random, or fully connected based on simulation parameters.

Each of these modules plays a critical role in simulating a network environment, enabling real-time tracking, topology management, mobility simulation, and efficient reporting of results.
