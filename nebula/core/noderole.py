class MaliciousNode(Engine):
    """
    Specialized Engine subclass representing a malicious participant in the Federated Learning scenario.

    This node behaves similarly to a standard node but is designed to simulate adversarial or faulty behavior
    within the federation. It can be used for testing the robustness of the FL protocol, defense mechanisms,
    and detection strategies.

    Inherits from:
        Engine: The base class that defines the main control flow of the Federated Learning process.

    Typical malicious behaviors may include (depending on the scenario configuration):
        - Sending incorrect or poisoned model updates.
        - Dropping or delaying messages.
        - Attempting to manipulate the reputation or aggregation process.
        - Participating inconsistently to mimic byzantine or selfish nodes.

    Attributes:
        Inherits all attributes from the base Engine class, but may override key methods related to
        training, aggregation, message handling, or reporting.

    Note:
        The behavior of this class is driven by scenario configuration parameters and any overridden methods
        implementing specific attack strategies.

    Usage:
        This class should be instantiated and used in place of the normal Engine to simulate a malicious node.
        It integrates seamlessly into the existing federation infrastructure.

class AggregatorNode(Engine):
    """
    Node in the Federated Learning system with full training capabilities and additional responsibilities 
    as an aggregator within the federation.

    This class extends `Engine`, inheriting the full Federated Learning pipeline, including:
        - Local model training
        - Communication and model sharing with neighboring nodes
        - Participation in the aggregation process

    Additional Role:
        AggregatorNode is distinguished by its responsibility to **perform model aggregation** from
        other participants in its neighborhood or federation scope. This may include:
            - Collecting local model updates from neighbors
            - Applying aggregation functions (e.g., weighted averaging)
            - Updating and distributing the aggregated model
            - Managing round synchronization where necessary

    Use Cases:
        - Decentralized or partially decentralized federations where aggregation is distributed
        - Scenarios with multiple aggregators to increase resilience and scalability
        - Hybrid setups with rotating or dynamically elected aggregators

    Attributes:
        Inherits all attributes and methods from the `Engine` class. Aggregator-specific behaviors are
        typically handled via the `Aggregator` component and configuration parameters.

    Note:
        While this node performs aggregation, it also fully participates in trainingâ€”its role is dual:
        **trainer and aggregator**, which makes it a powerful actor in the federation topology.

        - Tests the aggregated global model.
        - Performs model aggregation from participant updates.
        - Propagates the aggregated global model to participant nodes.

    Main functionalities:
        - Coordinating the aggregation of models received from participant nodes.
        - Evaluating the aggregated global model to monitor performance.
        - Disseminating the updated global model back to the federation.
        - Managing communication and synchronization signals within the federation.

    Typical use cases:
        - Centralized federated learning setups where training happens at participant nodes.
        - Server node acts as the aggregator and evaluator of global model.
        - Ensures the integrity and progress of the federated learning process by managing rounds and updates.

    Attributes:
        Inherits all attributes and methods from `Engine` with specialized logic for aggregation,
        evaluation, and propagation of the global model.

    Note:
        The ServerNode does not execute training itself but relies on receiving model updates from
        participant nodes for aggregation.
