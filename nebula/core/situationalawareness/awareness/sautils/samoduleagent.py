    Abstract base class representing a Situational Awareness (SA) module agent.

    This interface defines the essential methods that any SA agent must implement
    to participate in the suggestion and arbitration pipeline. Agents are responsible 
    for registering themselves, suggesting actions in the form of commands, and 
    notifying when all suggestions related to an event are complete.

    Methods:
    - get_agent(): Return a unique identifier or name of the agent.
    - register_sa_agent(): Perform initialization or registration steps for the agent.
    - suggest_action(sac): Submit a suggested command (SACommand) for arbitration.
    - notify_all_suggestions_done(event_type): Indicate that all suggestions for a given event are complete.
